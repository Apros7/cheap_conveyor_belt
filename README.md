# cheap_conveyor_belt

This repository contains files to build a cheap conveyor belt of any length and width. The picture is a belt of size 30cm * 2m and has a price of ~50$. This could work well together with a robot arm such as AlexanderKoch's [Low cost robot](https://github.com/AlexanderKoch-Koch/low_cost_robot).

## Contents:
In this repo:
- First a complete tutorial for building a 30cm * 2m as seen in the picture.
- Then a description of how you can modify the 3d-parts to fit other sizes. This is also useful if you are not able to get the exact copy of the materials (which is most likely the case).

In this repo:
- README.md
- 3d-parts: 3d-parts in .stl format for you to either edit or modify to your needs.
- budget.md: Table of how the money could be spent of this project.
