# cheap_conveyor_belt

This repository contains files to build a cheap conveyor belt of any length and width. The picture is a belt of size 30cm * 2 m and has a price of ~50$. This could work well together with a robot arm such as AlexanderKoch's [Low cost robot](https://github.com/AlexanderKoch-Koch/low_cost_robot).
